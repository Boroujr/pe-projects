        <h1>Burooj does Document</h1>

        <p>This is the opening paragraph. It explains the purpose of the document. The purpose is to complete the DFTW challenge of day 19 AKA word processor challenge. Not really sure what i should be typing in here. Hopefully this is long enough for a paragraph.</p>

        <h2>The Mall</h2>
        <p>I like Malls. Its like this internal system of shops and community. Theres usually a wide wide range of stores and theres a good bet you'd find what you want there. It's also functions as a social hub. Or at least it did for me when i was younger, so theres an element of nostalgia. I grew up in saudi arabia, so most activities needed to be indoor lest you scorch in the burning desert(though i also used to play soccer on sand fields at like 12 pm easily.. kids are scary resilient)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food court</li>
            <li>Whatever shop you want</li>
            <li>Cool air conditioning</li>
        </ul>
