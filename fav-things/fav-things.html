            <p>A language is a structured system of communication. Languages are the primary means of communication of humans, and can be conveyed through speech (spoken language), sign, or writing. The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary. Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation. Human language is unique among the known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound, etc.), is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems.</p>

            <h2>The Mall</h2>

            <p>I like Malls. Its like this internal system of shops and community. Theres usually a wide wide range of stores and theres a good bet you'd find what you want there. It's also functions as a social hub. Or at least it did for me when i was younger, so theres an element of nostalgia. I grew up in saudi arabia, so most activities needed to be indoor lest you scorch in the burning desert(though i also used to play soccer on sand fields at like 12 pm easily.. kids are scary resilient)</p>

            <p>

                <em>A belief in things not seen. We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more. But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.</em>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>A comprehensive understanding of consciousness will likely require theories of many types. One might usefully and without contradiction accept a diversity of models that each in their own way aim respectively to explain the physical, neural, cognitive, functional, representational and higher-order aspects of consciousness. There is unlikely to be any single theoretical perspective that suffices for explaining all the features of consciousness that we wish to understand. Thus a synthetic and pluralistic approach may provide the best road to future progress.</p>
