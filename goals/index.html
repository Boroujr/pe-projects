   <h1>My Goals..<em>ish</em></h1>

   <ol>
      <li>
         <h2>Nebulously defined</h2>

         <p>
            So, here i guess, i want to jot down the ideals id like to live by. My goals in that regard are to develop them concretely and to live by them eventually.
         </p>
         <p>
            I'd like to be self sufficient, and independent.
            and to be those id need to own responsibility for my self, since taking responsibility for yourself is the way to true freedom.
         </p>
         <p>
            the need to be independent has been a big part of me since, ive always remembered craving it through my childhood. perhaps it was a reaction to my overprotective parents, though i dont really see my siblings express it to the degree i do, so idk.
         </p>
         <p>
            Id also like to live for my <em>joys</em>. Im not a particularly career-focused indivudual and that caused me some existential trouble for a few years, until i started realizing i just enjoy regular old living, enjoy existence itself, the small things, my hobbies, dancing, stories, exploring experiences etc.
            and that <span>realization</span> somehow lead me back to going for a career cause i figured investing in one is likely the best <em>stable</em> foundation i can build for myself to palace other things onto.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>

         <h2>
               
         </h2>
         <p>
            so im supposed to be <span>selfish</span> here.
         </p>
         <p>
            Honestly idk, when I think back to 5 years ago, things were sooooooo different its crazy. Crazy how much and how little things can change.
         </p>
         <p>
            <em>like in 5 years id be <strong>30</strong></em> ü§¢
         </p>
         <p>
            But <em>pretending</em> things are perfect and <span>I</span> am perfect:
         </p>
         <ol class='innerlist'>
            <li>
               I'd reach a <strong>solid</strong> foundation of my identity and values to stand stably on. That even if the standing doesn‚Äôt happen id still be content with sitting or lying down.
               figured out my place in the world and how to navigate it.
            </li>
            <li>
               I'd like to be working I job I <span>enjoy</span>, and that pays well. 70k+ is what id define as great for myself. It‚Äôd have to be remote so I can travel as I place.
            </li>
            <li>
               I'd be travelling and visiting my friends regularly
            </li>
            <li>
               I'd be close to half way to retirement, or part timing. I work to <em>live</em> rather than live to <em>work</em>. So thatd include having a handful passive income streams set up.
            </li>
            <li>
               I'd be living in my own apartment, nothing fancy, but one like on a higher floor so i dont have to deal with <strong>spiders and centipedes</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
               I'd become an excellent strong dancer, <em>decent-good</em> at singing and the piano to play my fav music. im not getting to 40 without learning to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV1CMDhemt0">this!</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               I'd be finishing my degree, that im doing part time. And have the next few years planned out, begin transition into teaching(English) people in <span>Japan</span>.
               My interests are varied, so its likely ill switch careers a few times through my life.
            </li>
            <li>
               My blog will be thriving. Maybe id be figuring out a <span>story</span> to author, idk tho.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
            <em>Hmm</em>, im genuinely surprised at how big that list is. I don‚Äôt consider myself ambitious. Though I think id probably be a Slytherin.
            though perhaps to self identifying ambitious ppl theyd consider what ive written to be mild lol.
         </p>
         <p>
            A lotta stuff above not happening wont be too big a deal though, its <em>want</em> vs <strong>need</strong>. I guess 5 years and nebulous are alike.
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <h2>End of course vision</h2>
         <ol class='innerlist'>
            <li>
               Have a <strong>healthy and attractive</strong> portfolio.
            </li>
            <li>
               become more consistent and disciplined due to the courses nature. <em>its already feeling that, so yay</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Be skilled enough for an entry level job as a developer. Id still <span>prefer to be a developer than a designer</span> even though my interest in design is growing.
            </li>
            50k is my floor for the pay to <span>start off</span> with. Im pretty sure I wouldn‚Äôt want to work in a place too corporate-y. Somewhere small enough where people actually <em>know</em> each other. Though idk, maybe experiencing being a cog in the machine could be beneficial...üßê
         </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
         <h2>
            End of the month
         </h2>
         <p>
            Meet with Derek more consistently
