            <h2>Nebulously defined</h2>

            <p>
               So, here I guess, I want to jot down the ideals id like to live by. My goals in that regard are to develop them concretely and to live by them eventually.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'd like to be self sufficient, and independent.
               and to be those id need to own responsibility for my self, since taking responsibility for yourself is the way to true freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
               the need to be independent has been a big part of me since, ive always remembered craving it through my childhood. perhaps it was a reaction to my overprotective parents, though I dont really see my siblings express it to the degree I do, so idk.
            </p>
            <p>
               Id also like to live for my <em>joys</em>. Im not a particularly career-focused indivudual and that caused me some existential trouble for a few years, until I started realizing I just enjoy regular old living, enjoy existence itself, the small things, my hobbies, dancing, stories, exploring experiences etc.
               and that <em>realization</em> somehow lead me back to going for a career cause I figured investing in one is likely the best <em>stable</em> foundation I can build for myself to palace other things onto.
