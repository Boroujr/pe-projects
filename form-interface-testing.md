		* Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?
			* yes, easy and yes.

		* How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		    * the index page is clean. i like the description. im not sure about the boxes, them being different sizes is somewhat awkward.
		    * its also all the way to the left when on a big screen. centering with an inner-column would help out with that.
		    * i like the hover, the color is pleasant, remimnds me of his main site. the text becomes somewhat of a cutout cause its the same color as bkground which is pretty cool 




	### Forms

		* How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		    * i like the descrptions. its pretty clear even without it for the simple ones imo. but it a good idea for when it gets more complex.
		
		* Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		    * legible and clear, the buttons styling could be better, the rest of the design is flat compared to the button. maybe  the buttons from the main page could fit in.
		
		* Does the form work? Can you break it?
		    * yes they do. no. 
		
		* Do things jump around when you interact with them?
		    * no
		
		* Is the outcome clear?
		    * yes
		
		* Do the form styles match across all forms?
		    * yep
		
		* Is it a pleasure to use?
		    * other than everything being aligned left its nice. i enjoy the colors.
		
		* What could be improved?
			* im not sure about the black box at the top. i first though that was the output region, which would have been a cool idea. but it seems like leftover code from testing.

		* How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		    * the page is nice. the animation for the button links is cool. it feels very small and thin on my bigger monitor. 



	### Forms

		* How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		    * its clear, though i think theres a lot of space between everything. in the self checkout one, the fruit quantitiy is closer to eachother than to the speicific fruit's price.
		
		* Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		    *  yes
		
		* Does the form work? Can you break it?
		    * works
		
		* Do things jump around when you interact with them?
		    * not for the smaller forms. like on the self checkout page, after clicking on the submit button  the page jumps to the top. even though the results are at the bottom. 
		
		* Is the outcome clear?
		    * yes
		
		* Do the form styles match across all forms?
		    * yepyep
		
		* Is it a pleasure to use?
		    * yep, tho the inputs imo could be bigger.
		
		* What could be improved?
			* other than the above not much else.

			* yep difficult, esp for first timer. going to /e4p, there isnt an index page, so i see the default browser index. 

		* How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		    * there isnt one. no, i think if i didnt know what e4p was itd be confusing. 



	### Forms

		* How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		    * for the forms that i found and are complete its clear.
		
		* Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		    * labels yes, inputs are visible. needs more spacing.
		
		* Does the form work? Can you break it?
		    * the saying hello form works without a name being inputted
		
		* Do things jump around when you interact with them?
		    * yes, because of the input resizing the label moves to the left. tho thats only on saying hello
		
		* Is the outcome clear?
		    * yes
		
		* Do the form styles match across all forms?
		    * yes
		
		* Is it a pleasure to use?
		    * saying hello is
		
		* What could be improved?
			* the index page for now.

			* yes, easy.

		* How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		    * its nice, like the yellow, the text for the links are too small. theres a lot of space at the top. making the content live in the lower half of the page. most people look down at their screens or have their eyes lined up with the top. so this pulls the attention even lower.

		* How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
		    * i think a description would help a lot. 
		
		* Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
		    * labels are too small. i enjoy the font in the inputs
		
		* Does the form work? Can you break it?
		    * using placeholder instead of value for "enter a message" would be better. works otherwise. 
		
		* Do things jump around when you interact with them?
		    * nope
		
		* Is the outcome clear?
		    * yes
		
		* Do the form styles match across all forms?
		    * yes
		
		* Is it a pleasure to use?
		    * having to look down is uncomfortable.
		
		* What could be improved?
			* the styling and visual tricks are inconsistent. such as with the border radius in the button and the red in the input section.

		* How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
		    * pretty. yea the title makes it clear. i think some indication that the links are links could help. instead of just looking like a list.
