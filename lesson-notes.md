	* they are the same font?

	* if there is an input number why do we still have to convert from string to num?

	* required is cool. 


	* is the unique thing about <form> the method attribute? or is it just semantic box like section/div
		[yea seems like form's thing is the global variable storage]


	* derek personally attacking me with the label and placeholder stuff T.T


	* a common question,
		could use flex and space-between, while applying width with the parent. and swtching all to column when the largest label gets close. -ey the example ahs this.
