	how to take notes?


	i think all the layout practice has made the layout areas more intuitive. so yay past me!
	video bufferingzzz

	i ended up using grid for the full wide, instead of adding a text content box, though i had considered it.
	i almost bought clean shot. i probably will. my current one is becoming frustating.

	idk what to take notes on..

	template.php, start blending together while working with multiple. i name them the folder name.

	i rewinded the modules auto loading part a few times.
		does derek, mean the modules.css code automatically looks into modules folder and adds .css file import code? or that .css files only work when the .php is exists?

	why a h2 within the media-overview? i guess im still confused about h1-h6.
		is the h1 only for the first heading of the entire page?
		or does the herarchy get reset within each module, so we start from h1 within a module?
		or does it not matter as long as the smaller number is above a bigger one. so you could start with h4 and can only have h5 and h6 below.

	im not to sure about this markdown syntax.


	does there need to be <li> within ul/ol? its just a block level element right? couldnt we use <article> directly. does this have to do with screen reader accesibility? 

	oou, style guide is an interesting idea. also i like "stern-voice". 

	* does grid default to "column" direction?
		is the default grid just "1fr" making it a single row. answering my own question above.

	oh this screen reader only class is cool. idk if ive gotten to the point where im thinking about screenreaders yet.  


	using different media rules for different things like, images. good idea.


	grid is really cool. so a simple 1fr 1fr makes two columns, how does it decide the rows? is that dynamic?

	align self is cool, i had trouble dealing with the elements stretching it so ill be using this. 


	but trying something and smashing my head into walls is how i learn :(())
