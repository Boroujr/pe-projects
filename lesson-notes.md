# Styling forms part 1 - https://perpetual.education/resources/styling-forms-part-1/

	* placeholder is cool
	* they are the same font?

	* if there is an input number why do we still have to convert from string to num? 
		youd think itd happen by itself. 
		seems like its just more useful to use text. i wasnt able to input decimals when i used the number input.

	* required is cool. 


	* is the unique thing about <form> the method attribute? or is it just semantic box like section/div
		[yea seems like form's thing is the global variable storage]


	* derek personally attacking me with the label and placeholder stuff T.T


	* a common question,
		could use flex and space-between, while applying width with the parent. and swtching all to column when the largest label gets close. -ey the example ahs this.
